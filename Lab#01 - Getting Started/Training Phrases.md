# Invocations

+ If music be the food of love, play on.
+ This above all; to thine own self be true.
+ Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
+ Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
+ The course of true love never did run smooth.
+ But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, all losses are restor'd and sorrows end
